      # Using a "list" widget works, but is not ideal! Would prefer relation
      # widget referring to a separate "blogs" collection.
      # In this case, Blogs can not have any custom properties and do not have
      # dedicated markdown files.
      # Also, if a blog is not typed out just right, a new one will be created.
